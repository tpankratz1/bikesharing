# Bike sharing
## Overview
There was a need to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders wanted to see a bike trip analysis of Citibike bike sharing data from New York City, to be used for a final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

For this analysis, Pandas was used to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, a set of visualizations was created to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
- These new visualizations were then added to two additional ones that were previously created

## Results
